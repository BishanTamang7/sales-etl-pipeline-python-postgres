# Sales ETL Pipeline (Python + PostgreSQL)

## Overview
This is a simple **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** built with **Python** and **PostgreSQL**.  
It demonstrates a **real-world data engineering workflow**:  

1. Extract raw data from CSV files.  
2. Transform data by cleaning, validating, and calculating new fields.  
3. Load clean data into a PostgreSQL database for analytics.  

A **staging table** is used to preserve raw data, and a **final table** contains cleaned, analytics-ready data.
